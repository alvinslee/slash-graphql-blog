# slash-graphql-vue-blog
This is a public project with a quick-and-dirty Vue.JS client to demonstrate fetching data with a GraphQL request made to an Apollo GraphQL Server, which in turn makes a request of Slash GraphQL

## Project setup

If you don't already have @vue/cli installed, do this:
```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

## Pull down this code repository
```
git clone https://github.com/alvinslee/slash-graphql-vue-blog.git
```

## Make sure you have Apollo GraphQL Server running

According to the instructions in the accompanying article, spin up your local Apollo GraphQL server (probably with `node index.js`), which should then be listening on `http://localhost:4000`.

## Serve up this Vue.js client

```
npm run serve
```

## Open your browser

Go to: `http://localhost:8080`
